# Games

These are some smaller games I have worked on. They have been split into two categorier.
   The games in the "For School" category were made as part of assignments in University.
   The games in the "Personal" category were made for my own sake.

The reason for the divide is that some of the assignments had specific requirements for code-structure and can therefore be unlike what I may do on my own.

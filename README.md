# Portfolio

This is a compilation of a few different projects I have worked on over the years. 
Some of them have been for school, others were purely for myself.

## Structure

The two folders in here represent different categories.
   * The **Games Code** folder contains code for games that I have worked on. The scale and scope of these varies.
   * The **Other Code** folder contains code that is not meant to be a display of expertise in game-making, instead 
it serves to display my coding style and structure. I also works to show a bit of the range that I have.

Inside these folders are some more folders, each containing code from the project that they are named after. 
The **date** in the folders name represents when they were last changed.

## The Code

The code I have chosen to include are the classes that have something to show. While some of these projects contain
many more code-files, they are such small and simple files that it would be unnecessary to show them of. 
The code that I did not include fell under one or more of these criteria:
   * Was the code either not written by me or heavily influenced by other peoples code?
   * Is the only thing in the file a class or struct used to store data?
   * Does the file exist purely to test if something else works?
   * If it is a unity project: is it a scriptable object file?

As this code was meant to be seen primarily by me, there are very few (if any) comments, 
expecially in some of the older projects. The reason for this is that I recognise my own work and can, if needed,
work with some older projects after a short transition period.
